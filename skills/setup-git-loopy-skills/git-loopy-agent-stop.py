"""agentStop decision helper: re-enter `/next` when a completed run is unrouted.

Blocking is a route *request*, not a route. The block reason does not reach the
parent as a guarantee — the CLI presents it as a dismissible queued prompt, so
the operator can remove it, the session can exit before the forced turn runs, or
the runtime can hit its ceiling of consecutive blocks. Writing `routed` at the
moment of the block would record that intent as a fact, and every dismissal
would drop a chain hop while reporting nothing wrong.

So the request is promoted to `routed` only on evidence the block landed:
`stop_hook_active` true on a following payload, which is the runtime's way of
saying the parent took the turn the block forced. A single forced turn confirms
the complete batch requested by the block, and a payload without `sessionId` is
still usable because the runtime's evidence is the hook state itself. A request
that is never confirmed blocks again rather than being silently consumed.
